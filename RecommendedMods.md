Over time the group has come up with a set of recommended modifications. Here's an overview.

  * Upgrade PIC to 18F2620: This provides additional space, allows the use of a better processor, and supports a higher clock rate.
  * Use the UAVX firmware. There's UAVX firmware for both the original 16F876 processor and the 18F2620. Both will provide improved flight characteristics compared to the original UAVP, but please remember that these are considered to be permanently in a Beta test state.
  * Replace the 3.3V regulator.
  * Use a standalone 5V regulator instead of relying on the ESC regulator.

More recent UAVP boards from QuadroUFO incorporate the hardware modifications and have UAVX pre-installed.
