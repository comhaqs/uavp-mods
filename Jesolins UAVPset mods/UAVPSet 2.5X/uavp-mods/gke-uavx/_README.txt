 How to setup the Compilation Software      
=========================================================================

    * This version is for the 18F2520 PIC
    * Obtain MPLab and the C18 compiler from Microchip 

=========================================================================
 Transferring Firmware to the PIC           
=========================================================================

    * Use a PIC programmer to burn a version
      to the PIC - this will include the bootloader.
    * Once the bootloader is loaded once UAVPSet 
      may be used to load future versions of the
      flight and TestSoftware

 VERSION HISTORY                            
=========================================================================

The first part of the version history relates to the original UAVP software
written by Ing. Wolfgang Mahringer as is retained for context.

Some source files in this directory are derived from the the originals 
including compatibility with UAVPSet the PC based GUI.  The general 
control flow departs significantly from the orginal and should not be
confused with UAVP. It is expected that remaining elements of the 
original UAVP will be replaced over time. 


15.3.2007 V3.05/V3.10 released by Wolferl
First public released version.
- Reworked RX stick reading (does no longer influence PID controllers)
- Camera servos working. Use RX channel 6 für elevation control.
- "Model lost" beeper works now ONLY when ufo switch (K8) is ON (switch 
  open)
- Bootloader
- low throttle limit to prevent motor shutoffs while in flight
- spectrum DX transmitters are now supported.
  set the synchronisation gap to 5 ms or more.
- NEW: Holgers brushless ESCs are now supported and tested!

19.4.2007 V3.06/V3.11 released by Wolferl
- Bugfix: spurios beeps in flight fixed
- NEW: Holgers brushless ESCs are now supported and tested!

13.5.2007 V3.12 released by Wolferl
- Low voltage detection on the 3.1 PCB can ONLY be positive
- Version split vor ADXRS150 and ADXRS300 gyros
- Bugfix: only 3.1 PCB: beeper did not stop beeping when
  turning off the ufo switch
- Blue LED now flashes when doing M commands (setting params)
- Red LED now flashes if batt voltage is low,
  nice for those ufos with no beeper connected.
- Diff-factors on Roll and Nick are now pure differential factors!
  New P-factor = Old P-factor + old D-factor!
- compass sensor supported (on black PCB only)

04.07.2007 V3.07/V3.13 released by Wolferl
- 3.1 PCB and IDG300: Roll and Nick gyro is now measured with
  3.6 volts reference. When upgrading from a previous version,
  divide roll and nick proportional factors by 1.3
- Compass sensor HMC6352 fully supported
- flip problem fixed (limiting both motors now)
- smoothing of roll and nick stick signals implemented
- camera servos now selectable 0 or 45 degrees

30.12.2007 V308/V3.14 released by Wolferl
- Ufo now continues flight for 3200 cycles (30 sec at timing 6)
  if RX signal is lost
- quick beeping when signal is lost
- fixed DEBUG_MOTORS with I2C ESCs
- DEBUG_SENSORS for visualizing sensor data via UAVPset
- X flight mode now mixed correctly
  mounting change no longer needed
- Baro controlled flight altitude
  new register 4 (TempComp), 9 (BaroProp), 28 (BaroDiff)

02.01.2008 V3.15beta1 released by Wolferl
- AUX1 to AUX3 now do a running light, and show baro lock

04.02.2008 v3.15beta2 released by Wolferl
- fixed an overflow in baro lock (diff param)
- if ch7 on switch-on is > 30 use ch7 as cam roll trim

27.07-2008 v3.15 released by Wolferl
- better Acc-sensor read (saved 300us cycle time)
- Cam servos are active even with 5-ch receivers
- better baro sensor algorithm (since 3.15beta5)
- RX-yaw channel is now filtered like roll and nick channels
- optimized interrupt routine
- A/D conversion now uses more A/D setup time to
  yield better, more accurate results

19.11.2008 V3.15m3 Greg Egan
- added non-latching battery alarm and support for 
  Spektrum AR7000 Rx
- removed redundant source from Interrupt routine
- rewrote makefiles (makeall)

22.11.2008 v3.15m3 Greg Egan
- added lookupup table based throttle curve and range
  checking on maximum throttle. Commissioned but
  abandoned in favour of Tx based throttle shaping.

27.11.2008 v3.15m3 Greg Egan
- DSM2 support for AR7000 Rx includes:
  * Spektrum DX7
  * Futaba 9C with Spektrum DM8
  * JR 9XII with DM9 module

13.12.2008 v3.15m3 Greg Egan
- Limited Impulse to minimum 4 as values of 1 through 
  UAVPSet were causing spontaneous motor intermittent
  start!

07.1.2009 v3.15m3 Greg Egan
- Reduced _Maximum output pulse width to prevent 
  minimum width Rx pulses from being missed with
  interrupts masked.

UAVX ********************************************************************

13.1.2009 UAVX Greg Egan
- Port of V3.15 to 18F2520 abandoned. Only a small part of
  the original V3.15 retained specifically compatability
  with UAVPSet and gyro compensation the latter to be 
  reformulated later. 

  Control flow schemes rewritten for loss of signal and GPS.
  Adoption of pose angle control rather than hover with 
  direct control throttle offset.   

  Redesignated UAVX to avoid confusion with original UAVP.

 SAFETY FIRST!                              
=========================================================================

If you work on your Quadrocopter, PLEASE TAKE CARE!

Nowadays, extremely powerful motors and accumulators
can pose a serious threat to your safety.

Safety measures:

- Remove the propellers before you test parameter or firmware modifications
- Work with a good bench power supply instead of an accupack.
  A short circuit will then not be able to destroy your hardware too easily
- Your ufo mainboards electronics can be damaged by 
  electrostatic discharge sparks. Make sure you are doing any
  work at the electronics in an ESD safe workplace.
- When using your transmitter, be sure to use the correct model memory on it.
- Be sure to have no other transmitters on your channel on air.

The authors will NOT BE RESPONSABLE FOR ANY ACCIDENTS OR
INJURIES IN ANY WAY!

PLEASE do yourself a favour and get an insurance which covers risks by doing 
model flight!

Imagine what happens if you only damage someone else's car or something....
