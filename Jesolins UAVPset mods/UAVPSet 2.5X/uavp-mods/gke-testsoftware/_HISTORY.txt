= Transferring firmware to the PIC           =
==============================================

If you already have a PIC with at least software version 3.05,
You can upload your new version using the bootloader.
Use UAVPset.exe to do that.

But be careful: If you muck up things completely, you can lock
yourself out. Then you would need a PIC programmer to get things
working again.

= SAFETY FIRST!                              =
==============================================

If you work on your ufo model, PLEASE TAKE CARE!

Nowadays, extremely powerful motors and accumulators
can pose a serious threat to your safety.

Safety measures:

- Remove the propellers before you test parameter or firmware modifications
- Work with a good bench power supply instead of an accupack.
  A short circuit will then not be able to destroy your hardware too easily
- Your ufo mainboards electronics can be damaged by 
  electrostatic discharge sparks. Make sure you are doing any
  work at the electronics in an ESD safe workplace.
- When using your transmitter, be sure to use the correct model memory on it.
- Be sure to have no other transmitters on your channel on air.

The authors will NOT BE RESPONSABLE FOR ANY ACCIDENTS OR
INJURIES IN ANY WAY!

PLEASE do yourself a favour and get an insurance which covers risks by doing model flight!
Imaging what happens if you only damage someone elses car or something....

BUT PLEASE, BEFORE YOU ASK, READ THE MANUAL. It is all in there, really! 
The manual may be found at the original project site.

Also, if you have some hardware related questions, please download the 
datasheets for the chips and read them thoroughly!
