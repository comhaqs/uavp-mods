## Introduction ##

**WARNING** - the MultiWii firmware has not been test flown as is normally the case for the official releases of MultiWii. There are simple too many configurations of aircraft types and sensors to do so. Testing therefore tends to rely upon those interested in specific configurations doing their own testing.

Documentation for MultiWii may be found at the MultiWii main site:

This Wiki describes any differences specific to the port of MultiWii to the UAVXArm32F4 board.

### Motor/Servo Connector Assignments ###

With the exception of the quadrocopter connections the "K" output pin assignments are as follows. The quadrocopter connections have been temporarily made the same as for UAVX i.e. K1 Front, K2 Left, K3 Right, K4 Rear.
