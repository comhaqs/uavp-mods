## Stick Programming ##

The Tx sticks may be used to change some parameters or adjust the accelerometer neutrals in the field.

The blue LED will flash accompanied by the beeper when you have changed a setting. You have to hold the stick for 2 seconds before this happens and the change is accepted.

### Arming and Disarming ###

Normally you would arm/disarm using the arming switch. By selecting the appropriate checkbox in UAVPSet you can also enable arming/disarming using the **Aileron** stick. For safety the arming switch has to set to arm to enable stick arming.

### When Disarmed ###

Rudder and Elevator are used together with the Rudder selecting the parameter set and Elevator enabling hold heading or turn towards waypoint/home when returning to home or navigating. **Both sticks** must be moved for these programming steps.

  * Rudder stick left parameter set 1 and right parameter set 2
  * Elevator stick down for hold heading (default) up for turn to waypoint/home

### When Armed ###

It is inevitable that the accelerometer neutrals will require small adjustments regardless of how well you leveled the aircraft during setup.

You should **not** use the Tx trims which should be set to zero (no trims). Choose a day when there is no wind. You only need to do this once unless you have a major crash as there is very little in the accelerometer neutral values.

  * fly the aircraft pointing away from you and note the directions that it drifts.
  * land and, with the throttle closed but still armed, hold the **Rudder** or **Elevator** stick at maximum in direction opposite to the drift until you hear a beep.
  * Fly again repeating until there is no drift.

If you continue to hold the stick at the extreme after the first LED flash and beep, the change will be repeated every quarter of a second accompanied by another beep and flash.
