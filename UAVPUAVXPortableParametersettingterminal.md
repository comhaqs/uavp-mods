# UAVP/UAVX Portable Parameter setting terminal #
Hi All,
> I was working on a portable hand terminal for sometime to modify the flight parameters of UAVP/UAVX in the field while flight testing. I finished the unit and tested with UAVP and UAVX gkeware.
> I put together a manual for constructing and using it including the schematics for anyone who wants to build it. The latest version of source code and hex file for the PIC used in the terminal unit and the manual is included in the zip file attached. I hope this helps. Cheers, ba

**UPDATE:**
Hi All,
I have updated the UAVP/UAVX Hand Terminal zip file to include:
-Firmware for PIC18F2520 and PIC18F2620 as well as PIC18F4520
-PCB Layouts for 28 pin PIC and 40 Pin PIC versions.
I want to thank Don for his excellent support by designing these PCB Layouts.
-Updated const and user manual to include the additions.
I hope now it looks more flexible and easier for anyone who considers to build this Hand Setting terminal.
Cheers,
ba
